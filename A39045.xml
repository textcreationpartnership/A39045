            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Fact was too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, nor did be after Conviction offer to deny it; but rather made it his buſineſs to give Glory to God, by an open Confeſſion of his Sins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Sorrow and Self-abhorrency for them.</p>
            <p>And that he might the more effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this, Authority was graciouſly pleaſed to allow him ſome longer time than commonly is granted, to fit himſelf for Death.</p>
            <p>Theſe few days ſo charitably indulged, he failed not to improve, but huſbanded them with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the beſt advantage. Confeſſion of his Sins, with all their Aggravations, bewailing them with bitter Tears, and begging Forgiveneſs, as well for the Guilt as Scandal of them, was his continual Imployment.</p>
            <p>He was viſited by ſeveral of the moſt Eminent, Learned, and Godly Divines about the City, who at divers times came to give him their Advice, and afford him their Chriſtian Offices and Prayers; which he received with all Thankfulneſs, ſo that they departed much ſatisfied.</p>

is but Poetical Logic; the Charity of Divinity will never allow any to Brand or Stigmatize a whole Party for the Lapſes of any ſingle Member, when the Body gives no Connivence or Approbation to ſuch Exceſſes. The Doctrine and Diſcipline, the Orders and Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> every way fitted for promotion and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holineſs of Life, Sobriety, Chaſtity, and all kind of Chriſtian Vertues, and practical Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are ſufficient to juſtifie her to all the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate World, againſt ſuch ignominious ſcandals and undeſerved Obloquies.

            <p>As this poor Gentleman, led away by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Satan, and his own evil Nature, for want of keeping a due watch over his heart, and turning away his eyes from vanity, came to fall, like <hi>David,</hi> into thoſe blackeſt of ſins, Adultery and Murder: So we have good grounds from his late

            <p>As for the particularities of his Deportment, Penitent Carriage, and Religious Converſation, ſince the time of his Condemnation to that of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, all that viſited him (amongſt whom are many Worthy Divines, as aforeſaid) can bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And farther, that he might glorifie God in his Death, whom he had diſhonoured ſo much in his Life, endeavouring, if poſſible, to make his Repentance and acknowledgment of his ſins, as publick as the ſcandal of them had been; he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the few moments he had to live, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down his Meditations, and giving a warning to ſinners, by his ſad, but remarkable Example, and directing ſeveral Letters to his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Pariſhioners, and other Friends; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all compleated under his own hand, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to very Worthy and Reverend perſons, are to be made publick.

Some few days before that of his Execution, he humbly received the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and kept ſeveral private Faſts. The day before he ſuffer'd (being the Anniverſary Faſt and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for the horrid Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of Bleſſed Memory) he was, at his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſolemnly prayed for in moſt of the Churches of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and expreſſed great rejoycing in his Spirit, that his days were length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out ſo long in the land of the Living, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his expectation, that he might have the opportunity of enjoying the publick Prayers of ſo many good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>On Friday the thirty firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1678/9. about ten of the clock in the forenoon, he was brought out of the Preſs-yard, and in a Coach conveyed to the place of Execution, where he made an excellent Confeſſion and Speech to the People; a Copy of which (having it ready writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand) he there delivered to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter preſent, to be faithfully Printed with the reſt of his Papers, which are now in the Preſs, and within very few days will be made publick.</p>
